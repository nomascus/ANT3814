**Problem Set 6: Phylogenetics**

1) Download the [primate_mitogenomes.fasta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomascus/ANT3814/main/FILES/DNA/primate_mitogenomes.fasta). Use bash to print out the headers from each species in primate_mitogenomes.fasta file

2) Download the nucleotide sequences of the gene  MYH1 from 5 primates and one non-primate mammal (to use as an outgroup). Be sure to download them in fasta format

3) Concatenate the 6 fastas into a single fasta

4) Align your fasta sequences with mafft

5) Open the algnment file in mafft and find a conserved region and a variable region. Take a screenshot of each region and paste it here

6) Build a maximum likelihood tree with IQTREE using 1000 bootstraps. 

7) Open the tree in figtree, reroot it using the outgroup, and add the bootstrap values. Paste a screenshot of the tree here.
