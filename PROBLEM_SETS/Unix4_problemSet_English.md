1) Using the command line, write a for loop that prints the names of your five favorite movies. The format of each line should be: ```Movie name is one of my favorite movies```

2) Run the script [makeFiles2.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomascus/ANT3814/main/FILES/makeFiles2.sh) to generate 100 files. Find the files that have no leading zeros in their names, which makes them appear out of order. Rename the files so that all the filenames have three digit numbers in their names.
